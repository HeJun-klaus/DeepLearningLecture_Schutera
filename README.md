# Deep Learning Lecture
In this repository you will find *Deep Learning Lecture Material*. Consider this whole lecture a living and vivid thing: An evolving draft with regular over the air updates. Feel free to contribute directly, give feedback, report errors and link additional material (see contact at the bottom). So far covered:
  - Lecture notes 
  - Lecture slides
  - Jupyter notebook tutorials and excercises 
  - Flashcards
  - Literature
  
# Lecture notes
  Here you will find a draft version of the lecture notes (not available yet) and the lecture slides, feel free to contribute and fix any errors, typoes and mistakes you might find - thanks.
  During the lecture second screen interaction will be available through sli.do (get the app here: https://www.sli.do/)

# Flashcards
  These flashcards are based on Anki (get the app here: https://apps.ankiweb.net/). The flashcards revolve around fundamentals of deep learning (build based on: http://www.deeplearningbook.org). When memorized and understood, the content will kick-start you for the course and examination. The following Anki decks are ready to be imported into your app:
  1. DeepLearningLecture:Introduction 
  2. DeepLearningLecture:LinearAlgebra
  3. DeepLearningLecture:ProbabilityAndInformationTheory (tbd)
  4. DeepLearningLecture:NumericalComputation (tbd)  
  5. DeepLearningLecture:MachineLearningBasics (tbd)  
  6. DeepLearningLecture:DeepFeedforwardNetworks (tbd)
  7. DeepLearningLecture:RegularizationForDeepLearning (tbd)
  8. DeepLearningLecture:OptimizationForTrainingDeepModels (tbd)
  9. DeepLearningLecture:ConvolutionalNetworks (tbd)
  10. DeepLearningLecture:RecurrentNetworks (tbd)
  11. DeepLearningLecture:PracticalMethodology (tbd)
